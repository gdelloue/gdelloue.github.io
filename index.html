<h4 style="width:40%; margin-left:5%;color:#444;background-color:#fff;padding:20px; text-align:justify;border-radius:15px;margin-top:100px;">As a philosophy major turned copywriter, I believe in the power of great ideas and well-chosen words to change the world for the better. During my time in the creative industry I developed content for dozens of brands and managed multiple brand advocacy programs, including one for a major GE Healthcare initiative. <br><br>

I learned early on that the most effective marketers are those who understand and respect their target audience and strive to fulfill their needs. Having developed a passion for data, I'm now improving my technical skills at the Startup Institute to become a growth hacker and have an immediate impact on a startup's success.<br><br>
